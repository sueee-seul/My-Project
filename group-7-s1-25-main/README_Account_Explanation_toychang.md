## Author Contribution Note

### Background

During the course of this project, I have been contributing actively under the GitHub username **`toychang`**.

However, due to a misconfiguration in my local Git settings earlier in the semester, my commits were made using the following Git author identity:

```
Author: hzha583 <“hzha583@aucklanduni.ac.nz”>
```

Please note that the email address was **correct**, but was accidentally enclosed in **full-width (Chinese) quotation marks** instead of standard ASCII quotation marks. As a result, **GitHub was unable to associate my commits with my GitHub account** (`toychang`), and my contributions did not appear on GitHub's contribution graph or contributor list.

### Clarification

-  All commits authored by `hzha583 <hzha583@aucklanduni.ac.nz>` are indeed written and submitted by me.
-  All pushes were made to my own branch (`toychang`) and merged via PRs into the main branch.
-  The misconfiguration only affected GitHub's *visual statistics* and did not affect the validity of the work submitted.
-  This has now been corrected. Going forward, all commits will correctly use:

```
Author: hzha583 <hzha583@aucklanduni.ac.nz>
```

(with standard ASCII quotation marks, recognized by GitHub).

### Conclusion

I respectfully ask that the marker consider these contributions as authored by me (`toychang`). All commit histories, PR discussions, and implementation evidence clearly reflect my work throughout the project.

Thank you for your understanding.

— **Toy Chang** (GitHub username: `toychang`)
